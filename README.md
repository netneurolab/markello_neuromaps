# brainnotation-dev

Development repo for the [`brainnotation` toolbox](https://github.com/netneurolab/brainnotation).

To get set up you should use `conda env create -f environment.yml`, which will create a new conda environment (named `brainnotation_dev`) with everything you need installed.
You can activate the environment with `conda activate brainnotation_dev` and everything should be good to go!
