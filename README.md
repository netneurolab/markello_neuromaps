# neuromaps-dev

Development repo for the [`neuromaps` toolbox](https://github.com/netneurolab/neuromaps).

To clone use:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:rmarkello/neuromaps-dev.git
```

To get set up you should use `conda env create -f environment.yml`, which will create a new conda environment (named `neuromaps_dev`) with everything you need installed.
You can activate the environment with `conda activate neuromaps_dev` and everything should be good to go!
